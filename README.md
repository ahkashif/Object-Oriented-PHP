# About this application
This is personal repository to practice `Object Oriented PHP` concept. Resources are referenced from free online tutorial [Eduonix: Learn Object Oriented PHP](https://www.eduonix.com/courses/Web-Development/learn-object-oriented-php-by-building-a-complete-website)

This is simple application includes login/register and post/list/delete features.

I used `Object Oriented PHP` concept and MVC pattern to build it.

Routing is done by without using any existing frameworks.

ex>
```
http://mydomain.com/users/login

login = action
```
